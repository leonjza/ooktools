        Clean up a source wave file with PWM encoded data.

        The basic idea here is to read the source data and calculate
        the average height of the samples. Using this height, we iterate
        over all of the samples and replace the actual value with
        a 1 or a 0.

        Finally, in order to improve the graphing ability, we amplify
        the 1's value by 10000 and write the results out to
        a new wave file with the same attributes as the source.
